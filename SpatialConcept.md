# Spatial Concepts Experiment 
Extracting Spatial Concepts from image. Automatic concepts based on 
1. Basic concept of spatial continuity in horizontal, vertical or any other plane 
1. Color similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood  
1. Depth similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood
1. Connectedness similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood 

The model need not start from empty page. It could have built in concept of spatial continuity that it uses in learning process. 

The model should also not be supervised learning. It should be able to use above concepts to extract "things" in the image, without initially knowing what those things are. 

## Basic concept of spatial continuity in horizontal, vertical or any other plane 

How can we do this ? Does OpenCV cover some of these ? Would it be generic enough ?
