# Spatial Concepts Experiment 
Extracting Spatial Concepts from image. Automatic concepts based on 
1. Basic concept of spatial continuity in horizontal, vertical or any other plane 
1. Color similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood  
1. Depth similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood
1. Connectedness similarity/continuity in spatial neighbourhood 

## Basic concept of spatial continuity in horizontal, vertical or any other plane 

How can we do this ? Does OpenCV cover some of these ? Would it be generic enough ?
