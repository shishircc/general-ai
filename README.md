## Weakness of present approaches

Present ML approaches are purely statistical/mathematical in nature and create one model per task. This works for narrow intelligence but breaking out of narrow zone requires more than this approach. Below are some areas that need improvements

1. New Concept - Present approaches clearly lack ability to create new concept without any supervision or with minimal supervision
1. Logical Thinking Based on Attention - We humans can pay attention to a topic, and literally logically derive a conclusion without any stats of maths involved (except logic). Machines Presently don't do that. There is excessive dependency of prediction functions. 
1. Knowledge Graph - Present approaches devliver one new model for every narrow intelligence task. We on other hand don't do just one task but many and can switch models being used quickly depending on task at hand. There has to be a coordination mechanism for
