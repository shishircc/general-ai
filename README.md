## Weakness of present approaches

Present ML approaches are statistical/mathematical in nature. 

1. New Concept - Present approaches clearly lack ability to create new concept without any supervision or with minimal supervision
1. Logical Thinking Based on Attention - We humans can pay attention to a topic, and literally logically derive a conclusion without any stats of maths involved (except logic). Machines Presently don't do that. There is excessive dependency of prediction functions.
